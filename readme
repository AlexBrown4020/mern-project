**1. Project Outline**
Life in Balance is a mock application for booking online yoga classes where teachers can create sessions, edit and delete them.
Users can view all the upcoming classes and choose to join any that they like.  This application was built using a MERN stack.

**2. Installation**
- Clone the repository from github in your chosen directory: git clone https://github.com/AlexBrown4020/mern-project.git
- Migrate into the mern-project folder: cd mern-project
- In order to acquire the same dependencies and technologies, you need to install them: npm i
- Make sure you check the readme's included in the api folder and client folder and follow those steps.
- Create two new terminals, migrate one of each into the different folders: cd api / cd client
- Now we can run the API server and client side server in both terminals by typing: npm start 
- You should be able to see the backend API running and also a client front end.

**3. Future Features**
As the project progresses, I hope to include:
- Account page
- Payment method screen
- Calendar
- User profile pictures.
